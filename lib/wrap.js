//#region src/wrap.ts
/**
* Command wrapping for the rtk (Rust Token Killer) bash executor. Pure,
* side-effect-free decision logic: whether a shell command may be routed
* through `rtk` and, when it may, the exact `rtk` argv to replace the raw
* `bash -c` source with.
*
* The policy is conservative on purpose — wrapping is a best-effort token
* optimization, never a semantic change. Three independent guards, in order:
*
* 1. **Complexity**: any shell metacharacter that would survive rtk's
*    single-command boundary (pipelines, lists, redirections, command
*    substitution, shell variables) disqualifies the command. Wrapping those
*    would silently change what runs, so they pass through unchanged.
* 2. **Whitelist**: only a fixed prefix map of development tools that rtk
*    actually implements is eligible. The map keys are the *executable* name
*    the shell invokes; the value is the rtk subcommand name (they differ for
*    a few tools).
* 3. **Availability**: when the `rtk` binary is absent the whole transform is
*    the identity, so a deployment without rtk behaves exactly like the plain
*    local executor.
